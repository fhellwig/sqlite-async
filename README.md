# sqlite-async

ES6 Promise-based interface to the sqlite3 module.

The `sqlite-async` module exports the `Database` class. Each method works the same as the original [`sqlite3 API`](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API). Instead of callbacks, each method returns a promise. The `prepare` method returns a `Statement` instance that also wraps all of the original statement methods into methods that return a promise.

## Usage

```javascript
const Database = require('sqlite-async')

Database.open('test.db')
    .then(db => {
        ...
    })
    .catch(err => {
        ...
    })
```

The `test/sqlite-async-test.js` file provides examples.

## API

### Database.open(filename, mode)

Static method that instantiates a new `Database` object and calls `Database#open(filename, mode)`. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Database instance.

### Database#open(filename, mode)

Opens the database with the same arguments as the sqlite3 `Database` constructor. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Database instance.

### Database#close([fn])

Closes the database and returns a promise. If the optional provider function (`fn`) is specified, it is called as `fn(db)` before the database is closed. **This function must return a promise.** The database is closed regardless of whether the promise returned by the optional provider function is resolved or rejected. If the returned promise is rejected, then the close method itself will return a rejected promise with the error from the promise returned by the provider function.

### Database#run(sql, [param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Database#run` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the `this` parameter from the sqlite3 callback function.

### Database#get(sql, [param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Database#get` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the row.

### Database#all(sql, [param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Database#all` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the rows.

### Database#each(sql, [param, ...], callback)

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Database#each` method. The per-row callback function is requied. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Database instance.

### Database#exec(sql)

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Database#exec` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Database instance.

### Database#transaction(fn)

The `transaction` method allows a function returning a promise to be wrapped in a transaction. The function is passed the `Database` instance as its parameter. Returns a promise that is resolved with the function's promise value.

```javascript
db.transaction(db => {
    return Promise.all([
        db.run('INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, "two")'),
        db.run('INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, "three")')
    ])
})
```

### Database#prepare(sql, [param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Database#prepare` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Statement instance.

### Statement#bind([param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#bind` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Statement instance.

### Statement#reset()

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#reset` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Statement instance.

### Statement#finalize()

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#finalize` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with no value because the statement can no longer be used.

### Statement#run([param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#run` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the `this` parameter from the sqlite3 callback function.

### Statement#get([param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#get` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the row.

### Statement#all([param, ...])

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#all` method. Returns a promise that is resolved with the rows.

### Statement#each([param, ...], callback)

Equivalent to the sqlite3 `Statement#each` method. The per-row callback function is requied. Returns a promise that is resolved with the Statement instance.
